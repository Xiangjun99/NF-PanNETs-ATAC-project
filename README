Single-nucleus/spatial epigenomics in NF-PanNETs tissue
This repository contains the code for the manuscript "Spatial Epigenomic Landscape of Non-Functional Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Defines Tumor Heterogeneity and Progression". In this work, we present an integrative analysis combining single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) and spatial ATAC-seq across multiple tumor grades. snATAC-seq delineates the chromatin accessibility landscapes of distinct tumor subtypes, immune cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), revealing key transcription factor (TF) programs that drive tumor progression and shape microenvironmental interactions.   

![Overview of analysis](https://github.com/Xiangjun99/NF-PanNETs-ATAC-project/blob/1bb2de4a2b2fc8f50af4d5c72e8b396d894371eb/Figures/scheme.png?raw=true)


It includes: 
(1)code for processing and analyzing single-nucleus ATAC-seq;
(2)code for processing and analyzing spatial ATAC-seq.
