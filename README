Single-nucleus/spatial epigenomics in NF-PanNETs tissue
This repository contains the code for the manuscript "Spatial Epigenomic Landscape of Non-Functional Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Defines Tumor Heterogeneity and Progression". In this work, we present an integrative analysis combining single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) and spatial ATAC-seq across multiple tumor grades. snATAC-seq delineates the chromatin accessibility landscapes of distinct tumor subtypes, immune cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), revealing key transcription factor (TF) programs that drive tumor progression and shape microenvironmental interactions.

It includes: 
(1)code for processing and analyzing single-nucleus ATAC-seq;
(2)code for processing and analyzing spatial ATAC-seq.
